Upon checking in and entering the room, we noticed that the tv unit was not working, so when we went down and approached a hotel staff at the front desk. We politely asked if we could be assisted in checking the tv unit, they acknowledged our concern but no one came to our room to check the problem. Next morning, we woke up late and went straight to the 4th floor to have breakfast, one personnel approached us rudely and told us in a stern manner that we can no longer eat as we came in late. Fortunately, few minutes after there was another  staff who approached us and politely invited us to have breakfast. We were even willing to pay for our meals as we felt insulted on how the first staff prohibited us from having our breakfast.  The next</span><span class=\"_\"> day, we were ready to leave early so we would not miss our flight, unfortunately, as we were waiting for the elevator, all three elevators were not working, so we had to head back to our room to call the front desk as we were on the 9th floor and it was not practical to use the stairs considering we had heavy luggage. I was able to call frontdesk to report the elevators, I even politely informed this lady on the other line to kindly have the elevators checked as we could not go down, and you know how she replied, she said, \u201cour guests have no complaint in the use of the elevators.\u201d I again said, \u201c if that is the case, can you still have it checked as we already waited even deciding to skip our breakfast and proceed to checking out as we have wasted long enough for the elevators to function. One guest was also waiting for the elevator to function at that time, when finally the elevator opened and luckily reached the lobby, the guest immediately approached the front desk and made a complaint regarding the elevator, upon hearing this I also approached the lady in the front desk and told her that whoever received my call thought that I was lying because she did not even give us assurance that help was on the way. What was funny was , that lady who I suspected received my call and I confronted when I was at the lobby just ran to a nearby room and left without even acknowledging their mistake or at least apologize\u2026The experience in this hotel is so terrible and disappointing.

Got the triple room . Travelling with my kids . Very small rooms and third bed is on the floor. Third bed only had a blanket and no doona making it cold and uncomfortable at night . No privacy in the bathroom and you have no choice but to get changed in front of everybody in the room . You can\u2019t go to the toilet at night without waking everyone up with the light .  My aircon was cold but my friends room was hot after the third night they eventually moved them to another room but aircon was still hot even though mine was freezing , . Breakfast for westerners was minimal and not nice . Even the milk for cereal was hot . Would not stay again </span></q>"]},

The room is very spacious,new and clean.  Location is quite far from MRT, they have a shuttle bus going there every 1 hour. But if you missed it, you can always take public bus and it only take 2 stops to the station. Breakfast is okay, but the space is to small since there were too many people the time I stayed there, so I had to share a table with another guests. Shopping mall downstairs not open yet, so a bit hard to find things around the hotel. Overall still a nice experience staying here.</span></q>"]},

The hotel is brand new and since its a ibis which is a low budget hotel we definitely didnt expect a 5 star service. There is need to make a lot of improvement. I feel the hotel is not ready to open as their few staff needs serious trainings(specially the chefs) .   The rooms are good though i find it little conjusted because of the complex design. The paintmarks are still there on the walls and floor . The housekeeping service is very good and and the housekeeping staffs are really nice ,active and humble.  The front desk staff are  always smiling and very helpful.   The hotel is having only one restaurant and the worst part is</span>\u2026</q>"]},

Horrible idea !</span></span>"]], "reviewText": ["<q class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>This is a really bad case of hap-hazard design. Rooms are small and on top of this, there is no separation between bedroom and bathroom! This is horrible as you can't get any privacy if you are getting ready to sleep (in order to walk from toilet seat to the shower you need to walk through your bedroom !</span></q>"]}
